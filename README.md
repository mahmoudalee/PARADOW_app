# PARADOW_app
PARADOW team creates a minimalistic design for a product to enable users to draw on their walls 
and decorate it to help them change it continuously with higher accuracy and lower cost.
Therefore, we created a device that can be attached to the wall 
and connect to the mobile app that creates AR(Augmented Reality) environment 
to preview the image and send them from a mobile app to the device to start drawing.
